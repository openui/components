# Summary

A brief explanation of the proposed feature.

# Basic Example

If the proposal involves a new or changed component, include a basic code example. Omit this section if it's not applicable.

# Motivation

Why are you proposing this? What use cases does it support? What are your expected outcomes.

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop an alternative solution. In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Detailed Proposal

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the component and the design in enough detail for someone familiar with design systems and web components can understand, and someone familiar with the implementation help to implement it. This should get into as many specifics as possible, outline any edge cases or extra consideration, and include examples of how it can be used. Any new terminology should also be defined here.

It's important to ensure your proposal address the key goals of the OpenUI Design System to create a component that is:
* User Friendly
* Accessible
* Maintainable
* Internationalization ready

# Drawbacks

Why should the community *not* do this? Please consider:
* Implementation cost, both in terms of code size and complexity.
* Whether the proposed feature can be implemented in the user space
* The impact of the feature on people learning OpenUI's Design System
* Integration of the feature with others that exist and the impact on any compatibility with existing features.
* Migration implications for current users of OpenUI's Design System

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs or features have been considered? What is the impact of this not being included? Does this solution already exist within OpenUI, if so what makes this solution different?

# Adoption Strategy

If we implement this proposal or feature, how will existing users of OpenUI's Design System adopt it? Is it a breaking change to an existing component? Should there be any coordination with other libraries or communities?

# How we teach this

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this idea best presented? As a continuation of existing OpenUI Design System patterns?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the OpenUI Design System documentation must be re-organized or altered? Does it change how the OpenUI Design System is taught to new developers at any level?

How should this feature be taught to existing OpenUI Design System developers?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?
